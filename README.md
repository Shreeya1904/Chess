## Overview

This project is a web-based chess game where players can:

* Play against each other in real-time.
* Choose different time controls and be matched automatically.
* Enjoy a fully interactive chessboard with dynamic rendering and intuitive drag-and-drop piece movement.

The game demonstrates **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, **WebSocket-based real-time communication**, and **session-based matchmaking logic**.

---

## Features

* **Dynamic Chessboard Rendering:**

  * Built using JavaScript DOM APIs.
  * Interactive highlighting of valid moves and captured pieces.
* **Real-Time Multiplayer:**

  * Peer-to-peer gameplay powered by **WebSocket.io**.
  * Ensures smooth and low-latency move synchronization.
* **Session-Based Matchmaking:**

  * Players select time controls (e.g., 5, 10, 15 minutes).
  * Automatic pairing of players waiting for a match.
* **Move Validation:**

  * Enforces all chess rules (legal moves, check/checkmate detection).
* **Game State Persistence:**

  * Maintains current board state and timer across sessions.

## Installation

**Steps:**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-game.git
   cd chess-game
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open the browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Open the game in a browser.
2. Choose a **time control** for your match.
3. Wait for an opponent to be paired automatically.
4. Play your game!
5. The game ends when one player wins, loses, or a draw is reached.

## How It Works

* **Frontend:**

  * Renders chessboard and pieces dynamically using the DOM.
  * Handles user interactions like drag-and-drop and move validation.
* **Backend:**

  * Manages WebSocket connections between players.
  * Maintains matchmaking queues and pairs players based on selected time controls.
  * Synchronizes moves in real-time to all connected clients.
* **Match Flow:**

  1. Player joins a session and selects time control.
  2. Server pairs the player with another waiting player.
  3. Players make moves; backend validates and broadcasts them.
  4. Game ends on checkmate, stalemate, or timeout.
